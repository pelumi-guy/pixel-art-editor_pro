>I look at the many colors before me. I look at my blank canvas. Then, I try to apply colors like words that shape poems, like notes that shape music.

## Overview
I began learning about computer programming early this year - March/April 2022, so I read ***Eloquent Javascript*** Written by *[Marijn Haverbeke](https://github.com/marijnh)* on advise of a friend and mentor. After completing the book I went on to study on the React framework and Redux Library.

So I decided to recreate the one of my favourite projects from the book Eloquent Javascript with the other new technologies I have learned also enhanced it with a full UI hence **PRO**.
